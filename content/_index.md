## Abstract

The digital explosion has fundamentally changed our lives in just over two decades. The digital revolution changed communication, transportation and healthcare drastically among many other fields. In particular, the use and advent of **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)** devices propelled industrial automation at an exponential rate. This advancement is driven not only by the interconnection of billions of devices incorporated in industrial networks but also by exchanging, analyzing and utilizing information and thereby building a holistic and interlaced environment for future industries. Thanks to low Internet cost, the next decade promises the universal democratization of connectivity to every device. Significant drops in the cost of connectivity means that every form of electrical device will be connected to the internet. This vast pool of interconnected devices broadens the opportunity for better business and ease of life but also attracts the attention of cybercriminals.

While big corporations spend billions of dollars for the **security** of their systems, small IoT infrastructures often face negligence in terms of security and privacy. However, these systems deal with sensitive, private data. Although these systems are not too powerful, there are many. Thus cyber-attacks on these devices can lead to a catastrophe. For example, security flaws in a baby monitoring camera have serious consequences. Attacks like Mirai Botnet,  smart TV hack, smart-door-hack, and smart car hack fuelled users’ safety concerns. In the past decade, we have experienced that hackers often target the IoT devices employed in smart home systems and turn them into cyber zombies to mount large scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks on critical infrastructures of government sites. In May 2021, the Belgian Government had to deal with a massive DDOS attack which disconnected research institutes, universities and governmental services from the Internet. Although the exact source has not (yet) been located, it can not be excluded that many IoT devices might have played a role in this. One of the main reasons hackers target these platforms is that they lack security features and thus are easy to exploit.

As the old adage goes: **A chain is no stronger than its weakest link**. This also holds for IoT devices. Therefore it is of utmost importance that all devices provide a decent level of protection against cyber criminals. In the TrustedIoT project, we will focus on the hardware aspect of the security and develop and demonstrate ‘best practices for hardware-based security modules’. We will explore and compare existing solutions, considering commercially available modules as well as architectures proposed in academia. We will identify the shortcomings of these solutions for resource-constrained IoT devices and we will follow a bottom-up approach to build a trusted computing architecture (i.e., hybrid architecture) that overcomes these shortcomings. 

We will demonstrate our findings based on **five use cases** that focus on: 

* environmental sensing
* Industrial IoT
* Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
* mobile and cooperative robots.
